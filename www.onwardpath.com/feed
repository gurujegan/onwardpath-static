										<content:encoded><![CDATA[

One of the common requirements in Java web application is the secure storage of user passwords. Storing user password in plain text will pose a severe security risk and should never be considered. Passwords must be stored in such a way that there is no means of viewing the original password from the stored representation. There are number of algorithms in real world, here we are going to discuss about Encryption Algorithm &amp; Hashing Algorithm





<strong>Encryption Algorithm</strong>





This is an encoding technique in which message is encoded by using encryption algorithm in such a way that only authorized personnel can access the message or information. It is a special type of encoding that is used for transferring private data. In encryption, data to be encrypted (called plain-text) is transformed using an encryption algorithm like AES encryption or RSA encryption using a secret key called cipher. The encrypted data is called cipher-text, and finally, the secret key can be used by the intended recipient to convert it back to plain-text.




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-1769" src="https://www.onwardpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hashing-vs-encryption.png" alt="" /></figure>




<strong><em>Advantage</em></strong>




<ul>
 	<li>This
approach is better than storing the passwords in plain text.</li>
</ul>




<strong><em>Disadvantage</em></strong>




<ul>
 	<li>If someone knows the encryption algorithm and the secret key that was used for encryption, they can de-crypt the passwords.</li>
</ul>




<strong>Hashing Algorithm</strong>





In hashing, the data is converted to the hash using some hashing function, which can be any number generated from string or text. Few hashing algorithms are: MD5 &amp; SHA256. Data once hashed is non-reversible.




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-1775" src="https://www.onwardpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png" alt="" /></figure>




<strong>Hashing</strong>





Hashing is the practice of using an algorithm to map
data of any size to a fixed length. This is called a hash value (or sometimes
hash code or hash sums)





<strong>SALT</strong>





SALTED SECURE
HASH ALGORITHM (SALT): Salted secured hash algorithm helps protect
password hashes against dictionary attacks by introducing additional
randomness. Password hash salting is when random data – a salt – is used as an
additional input to a hash function that hashes a password. The goal of salting
is to defend against dictionary attacks or attacks against hashed passwords
using a rainbow table.





To salt a password hash, a new salt is randomly generated for each password. The salt and the password are concatenated and then processed with a cryptographic hash function. The resulting output (but not the original password) is stored with the salt in a database. Types of SALT are: Fixed SALT &amp; Random SALT





<strong>Fixed SALT</strong>





In this technique, we have fixed bit of same string,
(i.e.) if user uses same password, then the hashed password produced will be
same, so conflict get arise.





<strong>Random SALT</strong>





In this technique, we have fixed bit of random string,
(i.e.) if user uses same password also, the hashed password produced will be
different, so there will be no conflict.





<strong><em>Advantage</em></strong>




<ul>
 	<li>In this algorithm there is no way to regenerate the
password from the hash.</li>
 	<li>Whenever the user tries to log in, we will generate
the hash for the password using the same hashing algorithm and then compare it
with the hash stored in the database to check whether the password is correct
or not.</li>
</ul>




<strong><em>Disadvantage</em></strong>




<ul>
 	<li>The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is
not possible to recover a password; you can only reset your password.</li>
</ul>




<strong>Types of Hashing Algorithm with SALT</strong>





<strong>Type – 1</strong>:<strong> Hashing Algorithm with Fixed SALT</strong>





In both the examples, the password plus salt key will be stored in DB




<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ex &#8211; 1</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td>SALT</td>
<td>Hashed
Password</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test</td>
<td>“my-salt-text”</td>
<td>0e027d4dbc1bf55d733c5730cdb6799fb8f9e88a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ex &#8211; 2</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td>SALT</td>
<td>Hashed
Password</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test</td>
<td>“my-salt-text”</td>
<td>0e027d4dbc1bf55d733c5730cdb6799fb8f9e88a</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>




In this case where user is giving same password once again “Test”, therefore hashed password produced will be the same hash password” 0e027d4dbc1bf55d733c5730cdb6799fb8f9e88a”.





<strong>Type – 2</strong>:<strong> Hashing Algorithm with Random SALT</strong>





In both the examples, the password plus salt key will be stored in DB




<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ex &#8211; 1</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td>SALT</td>
<td>Hashed
Password</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test</td>
<td>“[B@3d747c7c”</td>
<td>0e027d4dbc1bf55d733c5730cdb6799fb8f9e89b</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ex &#8211; 2</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td>SALT</td>
<td>Hashed
Password</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test</td>
<td>“[B@5d747c77”</td>
<td>5cd2d52fa4c343d35d003d122e165afe7ab640a0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>




In this case where we are using random SALT, so using
of same password will not be conflicting with each other.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-1791" src="https://www.onwardpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RetainingEmployees.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Retaining A-Level Employees</figcaption></figure>




<strong>A trillion dollars.</strong>





According to Gallup Consulting, a trillion dollars is what U.S. businesses are losing every year due to the voluntary turnover of employees.





Here’s how it breaks down for an individual organization:




<ul>
 	<li>The annual overall turnover rate in the U.S. is 26.3% &#8211; Bureau of Labor Statistics.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
 	<li>The cost of replacing an individual employee ranges from one-half to two times the employee’s annual salary.</li>
</ul>




So, a 100-person organization with an average salary of $50,000 could have turnover and replacement costs of $660,000 to $2.6 million per year.





Voluntary turnover, in reality, costs much more than money. They include loss of reliable winners, constant innovators, and creative problem solvers.





Internally, it breaks down team morale. It can mean lost customer relationships, and in a few cases, it can even threaten your brand.





<strong>How do you find out the reasons for voluntary turnovers?</strong>





It is usually too late in the cycle. You get to figure that out during the exit interviews when it is structured as a purposeful exercise. This is a lot of valuable information and a significant source of data. If you heed the exit interview results, you can use that to retain the remaining A-level employees.





Most often than not, exit interviews are done as a process, and they don’t provide any insights.





Make sure that the exit interviews are defined purposefully and use that data effectively.





What is the percentage of people that look for a change?





40% of employees are planning to change in the next six months. 69% of employees are already passively looking. That’s an alarming statistic.





Happy employees rarely look for a job.





We spend a lot of time hiring the right candidates. Once we hire them, we want to retain them. That doesn’t happen because these employees aren’t happy as they are not looked afteremotionally and monetarily.





About 52% of the people who voluntarily quit say their manager or organization could have done something to prevent them from leaving their job. Half of them said that neither their manager nor any other leaders spoke to them about their job satisfaction or future with the organization in the three months before they left.





Think about it. In 3 months, nobody asked them how they felt about their job. Nobody talked about their future. So, it makes sense that they decided that they didn’t have one there.





<strong>Here’s how you fix this leak.</strong>





Train your managers and leaders to have meaningful conversations with employees about what matters to them. What’s frustrating them? What are their dreams? Where do they want to go?





<em>Employee complaints</em>





The most common employee complaints include &#8211; no clarity on expectations, no clarity on earning potential, very little feedback on performance, failure to hold scheduled meetings, and no framework to meaningfully succeed.





All of these can be attributed to managers and supervisors, and they ought to address these complaints regularly to sustain employee interest in their jobs.





<em>Allow employees to use their talents and skills</em>





I know a guy who is a stand-up comic, theater artist, character actor in movies, event host, and a partner relationship manager in a software product company.





The company encourages him to pursue all of his interests along with him doing the primary role of partner relationship manager. That encouragement keeps him going, as he is recognized for his skills and talents besides his contribution to his job.





Make sure that you allow employees to strut their talents and skills in a very creative manner.





<em>Make sure your senior management knows that an employee exists.</em>





A-level employees need not be in a senior position, but they probably have the potential to create world-changing products or solutions.





I know the CEO of an organization that had about 1500 employees. That is a large number for a CEO to interact with personally. The CEO of that organization made it a point to have lunch with different sets of people daily at the cafeteria every day. He gets to interact with four people every day, and in a year, he gets to meet almost everyone.





He ensures that he connects with them either at the work level or the personal level in terms of their interests, talents, place of schooling, or the language they spoke.





Not just your CEO, your entire senior management should make sure that they connect with employees at all levels and make them feel a part of the larger organizational picture.





<em>Responsibility goes with authority</em>





No employee wants to have just the responsibilities without the authority to deliver them.





Ensure that you trust your employees with responsibility and authority that would allow them to grow, gain new skills, and ample learning opportunities.





<em>Make sure that you reward your employees appropriately and frequently</em>





The rewards that you provide your employees should speak to their emotional needs in addition to monetary compensation.





Recognition is more critical in this context – can be in front of the entire organization, handwritten notes, wining &amp; dining with the CEO, and being made a part of the power circle.





<em>Offer the right benefits</em>





Make sure that your employees have the right work-life balance.





Consider giving them time off from work at regular intervals, provide paternal leave in addition to maternal leave, offer flexible work schedules, and remote working.





<em>Be prepared for voluntary turnover</em>





Having figured ways to retain A-level employees, do realize that it is not always possible to retain them.





Hence, be prepared to address their absence by having clearly defined processes that will prepare the next level to ensure business continuity.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">When I started in
marketing, I had a mentor who used to tell me, “If there is only one thing that
you want to do in marketing, it better be Search Engine Optimization (SEO).” To
this day, this advice remains invaluable and every digital marketer should
focus on this.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">However, most digital
marketers start on SEO and they lose steam sooner than later. Then, they put
their hands up and say that SEO doesn’t seem to work at all for their business.
It takes at least a minimum of 6 months before results start to show up and
most marketers don’t wait till such time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The key aspects of
SEO are that it takes time, it is a long-term strategy and every effort that
you put into it is worth your time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Having said that SEO
is long-term and it requires patience, how do I go about doing this right?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Well… there are no
quick fixes and search engines are too smart to see through the quick fixes.
You have to focus on making sure that your visitors find information that is relevant
and useful on your website, in addition to doing all the website housekeeping
like no broken links, defining tags and alt-tags, optimizing it for different
browsers, mobile and handheld devices.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">What are the key
strategies that you should consider when you want to optimize your site for
Search Engines?</p>



<ol>
 	<li><strong>Identify your target market</strong></li>
</ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Figure out who your
target market is and identify the kind of messages that interests them. This
would allow you to look at appropriate keywords for which you can optimize your
website.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Never begin
optimizing your website if you don’t have the target market clearly defined.</p>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Filter your search terms</strong></li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">You can’t compete
with the giants that are already there and who have optimized their site for
too long. Hence, pick your battles appropriately and filter the keywords
properly – identify search terms that have low competition and try to optimize
your website for them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Don’t go with a whole
bunch of generic search terms, which would be a brain-numbing task for you to
get them optimized.</p>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Local search needs optimization</strong></li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Google updates search
listing for geographical areas faster than industry categories. Add city and
state names, street addresses, zip codes, phone numbers, driving directions,
and create location-specific pages for every branch while keeping it consistent
with all your other properties like social and other online platforms</p>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Perform Search Engine Marketing (SEM) in addition to
SEO</strong></li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Search ads can
complement your SEO efforts easily. SEM is short-term and can help you get
traction on your website immediately, while SEO is long-term. In an ideal
world, do SEM for the first 6 months and SEO takes over from there.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">However, if SEM works
well, you might as well continue running them parallel to your SEO efforts.</p>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Voice search is the future</strong></li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">With the advent of
Alexa, Siri and OK Google, 20% of the searches have been voice searches.
Optimization your website for voice is not straightforward and you need to
perform the following smarts to do that:</p>



<ul>
 	<li>Most voice searches are for local businesses. Ensure
that you have an updated Google My Business profile with name, hours, street
address and other relevant information</li>
 	<li>Create location-specific pages that would show up in
voice searches</li>
 	<li>Keep your content conversational in your copy as it is
more likely to be picked up by the search engines</li>
 	<li>Design for mobile as the mobile metadata is what is
used in your voice search</li>
 	<li>Convert your keywords into questions. Instead of ‘Gym
Equipment,’ change it to ‘Where can I find Gym Equipment near me?’</li>
 	<li>Use long-tail keywords as they are more likely to
figure in voice searches instead of the short ones that you target for your web
and mobile</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Make sure that you
audit your website at regular intervals to ensure that you don’t have issues
like broken HTML, broken links, and badly crafted keywords. You can use tools
like <a href="http://www.ubersuggest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubersuggest</a> for your keyword suggestions and
<a href="http://www.answerthepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnwerThePublic</a> for long-tail
keywords. This would allow you to include them organically as a part of your
content.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img class="wp-image-1742" src="https://www.onwardpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unnamed-1-1024x634.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="391" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The grapevine indigital marketing circles lately is
that email marketing does not have a future.</p>




Could this be true?




<p class="has-text-align-justify">“In God we trust, all others must bring data,” is the
famous saying of Edwards Deming and I fully believe in that saying. Let us look
at the data in front of us to figure out if email marketing is dying.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Point1:</strong>Millenials and
Gen Z do not check their emails as often as the generations before them</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Point
2:</strong> People now have an attention span of 8 seconds, which is shorter than
the attention span of a GoldFish at 9 seconds – Microsoft research. Most
likely, emails may not work in this scenario</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Point
3:</strong> Emails are one-way communication while today’s markets prefer
conversational means of communication available with social and messaging apps</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Are these points good enough for us to chuck email
marketing from our digital marketing repertoire?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Before we get there, let us look at some of the
counterpoints.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Counterpoint
1:</strong> I receive an average of 150 emails per day and I read and respond to at
least 60 to 75 of them every day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Counterpoint
2:</strong> Close to 100% (well actually 92%) of Internet users have an email
account – Fourth Source Website</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Counterpoint
3:</strong> Email marketing is 40% more effective than social media – McKinsey
report</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Counterpoint
4:</strong> 99% of consumers check their email daily with more than 50% checking
personal accounts more than 10 times a day – HubSpot</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Counterpoint
5:</strong> Email has better ROI in comparison to any other channels and the
delivery rates are higher than most channels</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The counterpoints seem to be a clincher in favor of
email marketing. However, why is it perceived to be something that is not
working in the digital marketing world?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Very few people find the emails that they receive are
useful to them. Like any marketing message, emails to be differentiated,
meaningful, personalized, delivering relevant messages based on geographic
location, interests, and purchase history.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Also, you shouldn’t be sending the same message to
everyone on your list. You should be able to understand your recipients and
segment them into multiple buckets. Once this segmentation is done, you should
send relevant messages to the list.</p>




<strong>A
case in point</strong>




<p class="has-text-align-justify">I was heading marketing for an organization in the B2B
space and we had built a huge list of subscribers in a span of more than ten
years. We were constantly communicating with them using emails – both
educational and promotional content.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This effort was bringing in a substantial number of
leads, close to 100 qualified leads in a month. People in my team though
weren’t very kicked about sending emails and they always wanted out of it and
try out other channels of communication. Though we had a bouquet of activities
including thought leadership, event participation, speaking gigs, and social, I
still did not want to lose out on the leads that we were generating from email
marketing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I went and told my team members that I am fine with
dropping email marketing as long as they figure out other ways to generate the
100 qualified leads every month. I didn’t want to fix something that wasn’t
broken.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">To date, and it has been 10 years since I quit that company, I hear that email marketing is still one of their best-performing tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is logging?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tracing program execution during development</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Providing an audit trail for a program</li>
<li>Recording soft-errors (lost connections, etc.) for monitoring performance and troubleshooting</li>
<li>A logging framework lets you use different logging levels</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding logging code</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replaces <em>System.out.println()</em> calls throughout</li>
<li>Utility of logging code is improved if it’s consistent—logs can be searched.</li>
<li>Five recognized message priorities: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR &amp; FATAL</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing Log4J</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download a zip or compressed tar file from Apache.org website</li>
<li>Uncompress to a local directory</li>
<li>In your Eclipse project’s properties, Locate Java Build Path &#8211; On Libraries page, click on Add External Jars</li>
<li>Browse for your Log4J directory, and locate the log4J jar file in the /dist/lib directory</li>
<li>Click Open, followed by OK</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a Log4J configuration file</h3>
<p>The easiest way to configure Log4J is to add a <em>log4j.properties</em> file to your source directory. There are many options available which we won’t cover here, but essentially you need to define:</p>
<ul>
<li>A logger</li>
<li>An appender</li>
<li>A pattern layout</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Log4j Set-Up Process</h4>
<p>The following example uses the default root logger, appends to the console and prints the date, time, message priority, thread and message</p>
<p><b>Step 1 &#8211; Download the Log4j library</b></p>
<p>If you are using Maven 2 for your project, you do not need to download the binary. You can simply declare it as a dependency in your Maven 2 <em>pom.xml</em> and Maven will grab the library for you. Declare it as follows</p>
<p><tt>&lt;dependency&gt;<br />
&lt;groupId&gt;log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;<br />
&lt;artifactId&gt;log4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br />
&lt;version&gt;1.2.17&lt;/version&gt;<br />
&lt;/dependency&gt;<br />
</tt></p>
<p><b>Step 2 &#8211; Import the jar file into your web project</b></p>
<p>If your using Maven 2, you can skip this step; after declaring the dependency, Maven will put the jar file in the proper place automatically when you build.</p>
<p>Import the <em>log4j</em> jar file into your <em>JavaBuild</em> Path</p>
<p>Download from here: <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/l/Downloadlog4j1217jar.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Downloadlog4j1217jar</a></p>
<p><b>Step 3 &#8211; Create Log4j Properties file</b></p>
<p>In Eclipse, right click on the <em>src</em> folder</p>
<p>Select New &gt; Others &gt; File</p>
<p>Create file with name <em>log4j.properties</em> and add below property settings</p>
<p><tt># Root logger option<br />
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, file<br />
# Direct log messages to a log file<br />
log4j.appender.file=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender<br />
#Redirect to Tomcat logs folder<br />
#log4j.appender.file.File=${catalina.home}/logs/logging.log<br />
log4j.appender.file.File=C:\log\applog.log<br />
#log4j.appender.file.File=C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\geologs\applog.log<br />
log4j.appender.file.MaxFileSize=10MB<br />
log4j.appender.file.MaxBackupIndex=10<br />
log4j.appender.file.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout<br />
log4j.appender.file.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} UTC %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n<br />
</tt></p>
<p><b>Step 5 &#8211; Put logging code in your classes</b></p>
<p>The last thing you need to do is drop some logging code in a class and test this whole setup.</p>
<p>Add the following to the imports section of your java code:</p>
<p><tt>import org.apache.log4j.Logger;<br />
static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(MyClassName.class);<br />
</tt></p>
<p>Throw some logging statements in your code where you know they&#8217;ll be fired right away when you run your app. For example:</p>
<p><tt>log.trace("Hello");<br />
log.debug("Hello");<br />
log.info("Hello");<br />
log.error("Hello");<br />
log.warn("Hello");<br />
log.fatal("Hello");<br />
</tt></p>
<p><b>Step 6 &#8211; Run your app and make sure it works</b></p>
<p>Finally, run your app and make sure it works. You should see log lines in your file where you setup your appender.</p>

2019 was touted as the
year of emerging technologies like voice search, and artificial intelligence.





How did they perform?
Did they remain as emerging technologies or have they made an impact in our
everyday business?




<p class="has-text-align-justify">From a digital
marketing standpoint, artificial intelligence, voice search, personalization,
location-based information, real-time ads focused on your consumption or
behavior patterns have become mainstream and have become the must-dos in a
digital marketer’s armor. This is enhanced by the availability of 5G networks.</p>




Let us look at them in
detail here:





<strong>Voice
search</strong>




<p class="has-text-align-justify">I know an 80-year-old
person who is not technology savvy and he isn’t someone who looks forward to
using technology for his day-to-day affairs. He carries a smartphone as is the
norm nowadays and he was using it only for making and receiving calls. However,
things changed in the last year when he started to use “OK Google” to navigate,
identify locations, to shop, and to know about events and sports regularly. He
loves his smartphone now more than ever as it has allowed him to be
independent.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This was made possible
only because of the voice search. In his case, it was Google. Others that are
prominent in this space include Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Cortana’s
Cortana.</p>




Now, all of these
engines are getting integrated into the enterprise apps as well and their usage
is soaring.




<p class="has-text-align-justify">Businesses need to be
optimized for voice search. About 30% of the search in 2020 is expected to be
voice. When you look at it, it is an unaddressed area, as only 4% of the
businesses are currently optimized for voice search. Amazon alone is expected
to drive about $5 billion in revenues through voice search in 2020.</p>




<strong>Artificial
Intelligence</strong>




<ul>
 	<li>Are you learning what your consumers want?</li>
 	<li>Do you know what your customer’s behavior looks like?</li>
 	<li>Do you know the interests of your customer segments?</li>
</ul>




Are we capturing all of
this information in a structured format?





What do we do with this
learning?




<p class="has-text-align-justify">This is fairly complex
when you try to understand them manually and leverage it for your digital
promotions. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in.</p>




However, most
enterprises haven’t adopted AI systems that would help them run their businesses
smarter and profitable.




<p class="has-text-align-justify">AI adoption in the
Enterprise, a report done by O’Riley found that under 75% of respondents were
either evaluating or not yet using AI. This means only 25% of the enterprises
have adopted AI, which puts them in a very advantageous position.</p>




AI systems would allow
these enterprises to personalize and focus their promotions to their target
segments creatively and profitably.




<p class="has-text-align-justify">As you may know, AI
systems continue to learn and optimize actionable outcomes. This would put
enterprises that have functioning AI systems will reap the benefits.</p>




It is time that you
drive your promotional strategies with AI systems at the core.




<p class="has-text-align-justify">Voice search and
Artificial Intelligence are going to be key for organizations in the coming
years. This would allow you to address your user expectations and give them
what they want, where they want and when they want it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Is Jan 2020 any
different from Dec 2019? Most likely not, however, it is that time of the year
when you start making lists. Here is our list of the 5 key marketing strategies
that every marketer should look at in 2020.</p>



<ol>
 	<li><strong>Content is still king!</strong></li>
</ol>




According to Content
Marketing Institute’s 2019 trends report, 77% of B2B marketers use content
marketing.





They use educational
content and not promotional content to generate and nurture leads and build
audience trust. Content marketing is the holy grail of any inbound marketing
program.




<p class="has-text-align-justify">Marketers use a
variety of content that includes blogs, articles, white papers, case studies,
newsletters, videos, infographics, webcasts, podcasts, eBooks, how-to guides,
and social media content.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is great to have
all of these, though it is not necessary to have all of these. You can start
small and focus on a few content types before you spread yourself into other
areas. This way you will know what works and what doesn’t with your audience
segment.</p>




How do you go about
creating content for your business?





Few steps to look at
include:




<ul>
 	<li>Create a content plan</li>
 	<li>Identify the assets that you want to create and the resources
available to create those assets</li>
 	<li>Make sure that you have some fresh content every week</li>
 	<li>Constantly update your content – we will look at this
in detail later in this piece</li>
 	<li>Create a calendar and stick to the calendar</li>
</ul>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Personalize your marketing messages</strong></li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Every consumer wants
to be made special. When I get to see what I am looking for, the experience is
different. Automation, analytics, and demographics are the way to go when you
want to personalize your messages.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">At the same time, you
have to be careful not to bombard your audience with too much content and make
sure that every interaction is useful and relevant to them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Also, look at
behavioral segmentation based on what the users read, what did they do in your site
– made a purchase, abandoned the cart, abandoned after providing payment
information, or made a repeat purchase.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This would allow you
to separate them into groups and you can speak to each group based on how they
interact with your brand.</p>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Do your original research</strong></li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Speak to your target
segments and customers and try to understand things from their perspective.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I was recently
talking to a customer of ours and he shared this insight. They are into
business intelligence and they were serving a handful of customers. One of
those customers was a long-standing one and the engagement was constantly
going. He asked them as to why they continue to engage them?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The answer that he
got was, “whatever we throw at you when it comes to business intelligence, you
are able to deliver” and that’s the reason why we continue to work with you.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This insight allowed
them to reposition themselves and they started getting more business.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Talking to your
customers, prospects and user groups allows you to get a unique angle on your
product stories or service stories. This would let you target your audience in
ways that wouldn’t be possible otherwise</p>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Constantly update your content</strong></li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I was watching a
video of Neil Patel on how he was able to increase his website engagement by
238% in 2019.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">He started with a
base of more than a million visits already.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the key
strategies that he talks about is updating the content regularly. In fact, he
writes a blog post every week and has his team of 3 content developers update
about 90 articles/blogs every month.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After all, search
engines prefer fresh content and it is a sure-shot way to rank higher on the
search, resulting in more visitors and customers.</p>



<ul>
 	<li><strong>Start making explainer videos</strong></li>
</ul>




Have you tried
explaining complex concepts?




<p class="has-text-align-justify">The best way to
explain is to do that with videos. There are umpteen tools available that would
allow you to produce explainer videos very easily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Explainer videos
allow you to explain complex concepts concisely. Most organizations use them to
explain the benefits and functionality of what they do in an unambiguous
manner. Search engines tend to rank videos better than other forms of content.
So, it makes a lot of sense to invest your time and budget in explainer videos.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Some of the companies
that have made the most of explainer videos include Dollar Shave Club, Spotify,
Microsoft, Crazy Egg, Chipotle and PayPal.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">These are simply
bite-sized videos and the core focus will have to be towards making them
simple, understandable and relatable to your audience.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Attempt these 5 key
strategies and your engagement with your audience would increase manifold.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-1654" src="https://www.onwardpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2nd-1024x634.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">I was helping a Men’s
underwear brand market their products online. We tried several things before we
could make it successful. This blog is all about what worked for us and how you
can make use of it for your products.</p>




When we started, we
began with Facebook and Google advertising to drive traffic to our website. We
were able to drive a lot of traffic to our website but that wasn’t getting
converted into orders. The conversion rates were anywhere between 1% and 2%.





Many added our
products to their carts and many of them even entered their payment details
before abandoning the purchase.





While we were
successful in the first step of driving traffic, it was hard to convince
someone to buy a product.





We poured through several
studies, statistics and we did a lot of analysis on what needed to be done. We
came up with the following hacks that worked for us and we believe that it
would work for you as well.





<strong>Hack
#1: Video of our product</strong>





We video graphed our
product being worn by models. With the video demonstration, we made sure that
visitors spent more time on our site that allowed them to purchase the
products. This was a game-changer as the conversions increased two-fold
immediately and it keeps going up.





<strong>Hack
#2: User reviews</strong>





We encouraged our
customers and the early adopters to write real reviews on our site about the
product. We added their photographs and the unpacked photographs of the product
along with the reviews. Anyone who reviewed got an additional discount on their
next purchase, irrespective of whether the review was good or bad.





<strong>Hack
#3: Customers as our ambassadors</strong>





We came up with
multiple fits using various materials. We did wearer testing using our existing
customers. We sent one pair of every new design and material to each of the
testers. We got feedback from them in terms of comfort, fit, coverage and style
and we published the feedback that we received on our website and our social
channels. This resulted in our sales going up substantially.





<strong>Hack
#4: Focus on existing customers </strong>





We focused on our
existing customers and our repeat orders became huge. Acquisition cost with
existing customers is near-zero and the conversion rates were in the range of
8% to 10%.





<strong>Hack
#5: Personalized promotions </strong>





We had three design
cuts in a variety of materials – trunks, briefs, and boxer briefs for various
types of bodies.





We focused our
promotions in a personalized manner addressed those body types:




<ol>
 	<li>Gym-honed and toned men</li>
 	<li>Well-endowed men and men with thighs</li>
 	<li>Taller men and men with larger butts</li>
</ol>




Different cuts of
ours worked well for these body types. We designed specific landing pages that
brought out the features and benefits of the products while addressing the
typical challenges that these body types face while using underwear.





This campaign was a
huge hit among our audience.





Every marketer wants
to offer a better customer experience, which in turn would result in better
revenues. The aforementioned digital marketing hacks were based on our own experience
and we believe that this would add value to any eCommerce and online
marketplace selling.

<strong>What
do these things mean to a marketer? </strong>





Digital channels,
touchpoints and choices continue to expand – web, social, offline with shoppers
jumping between online and offline channels. Also, Omnichannel is gaining a lot
of traction. This results in complex customer journeys.





For marketers, making
sense of how to engage customers in their preferred channels has never been
trickier.





<strong>What
should marketers do to sail through this complexity? </strong>





Most marketers make
the mistake of looking at it from the operations perspective and not from the
business and customer perspective. They end up buying expensive technology that
can deliver all the channels. Let us assume that you have all the channels that
your customers would probably like, you still have to make sure that those
channels are serviced and make sure that it works for you.





Let us look at a
step-by-step approach of how your digital marketing can be structured keeping
in mind the evolving complexities of the customer journey.





Let us assume that
you know who your target customers are and the value of what you are selling
them. What you need to crack here is &#8211; how do you engage them and how do you
take their conversations to conversions. The key steps that marketing should
look at include:





<strong>Identify
your channels and equip yourself to serve!</strong>





Email, Web, Chat,
Voice, Video, Social and Offline are the possible channels and there are
subsets within them. On the social, you are looking at Facebook and Instagram
if your target customers are millennials and LinkedIn and Twitter if your
target customers are B2B.





Besides, you would
also have information related to how your website is being used, how your
social channels are used, how your customer service and customer support are
used. Based on this, you can make an informed decision to enable the channels
that your customers and prospects are most likely to use.





Once you have
identified the channel, you have to figure out a way by which you intelligently
route conversations and interactions to the right resources within your organization
in a real-time manner. Only then, it would provide the necessary experience.





Ensure that you have
the right technology to make this possible and ensure that you have the right
resources available to address the needs of your prospects and customers.





<strong>Keep
your website mobile-friendly</strong>





Mobile offers
ubiquitous-ness and immediacy to everything that the user does. Most searches
originate from a handheld or a mobile device. Any friction in that experience
will result in lost revenues.





<strong>Single
view of the customer </strong>





You need to have the
right technology to ensure that all the interactions and conversations of
customers and prospects are captured. This would allow your marketing message
owners and agents to provide the right information, upsell, cross-sell and
resolve issues &#8211; allowing your customers to experience your offerings
positively.





<strong>Personalize.
Personalize. Personalize.</strong>





You understand the
habits of your visitors to your website, eCommerce platform, social pages, and
chatbots among others.





Make sure that you
dynamically deliver what the user is most likely expecting to see. For
instance, if the user’s preference is all about expensive watches, ensure that
it is displayed as soon as the user logs in to your site.





Another example can
be, when you know that the user has surfed your banking site for business
loans, show them the offers on business loans when they login again. That makes
the experience worthwhile for the users and it makes business sense for you.





<strong>Have
a content plan </strong>





Content budget in
most organizations go up year-on-year. However, they don’t have a formal
content development or management plan.





Every content piece
that is created should have a purpose – target audience, expected results,
asset reuse in different channels, multimedia to go with the content like
images and video. There has to be a way to measure the results on how the
content is performing and that should be a part of the feedback loop on what
gets generated month-on-month.





In essence, marketers
need to look at their marketing holistically and it is cyclical as well as
structural in nature. The three key things to look at are:





<strong>Customer insights</strong>–track and
analyze customer behavior. Deliver insights regularly to the decision-makers





<strong>Customer experience </strong>– define and
design customer journeys based on insights. Integrate functions and features to
deliver a great experience





<strong>Measure effectiveness</strong> – continuously track and manage the programs and campaigns. Adapt based on the feedback. Customers are using possibly all the available channels to arrive at their purchasing decisions. As a marketer, use data to map customer needs, wants, and desires and use those insights to develop superior customer experience.
